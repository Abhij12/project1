Problem Statement :- My college Faculitites addresses the problem that they want begineer c programmers to use more Turbo c compiler for following reasons:-
                    1.students have to type every letters, words and symbols which help them to remember syntax.
                    2.It helps students to easily debug and find errors.
                    But, most of students do not want to use Turbo c compiler because it does not have cool features.

That's Why i code some header files to visualise the some basic code Graphically

How to use it:-
 1.Make sure you have Turbo c/c++ .(Because currently it only runs in Turbo c/c++)
 2.Copy and Save both header files in Your Turboc > include folder(In my case C->Turboc->Include)
 3.Now, open your Turbo c .
 4.Make a new c file and include Integer_array_operation(#include<Integer_array_operation.h>) 
   and call any of the function
   1.Array_1d()
   2.Array_2d();
   3.bubble();
   4.bubble_circle();
